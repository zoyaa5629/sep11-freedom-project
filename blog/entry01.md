## Context
This year for my freedom project I am using the tool [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). This year's project will be different unlike last year where we had to make a webpage but this year we are making a game. My tool last year was Aframe and it was used only in a small portion of my freedom project but this year my entire project will be made using Phaser which is my tool. It was really hard starting off with Phaser since it required dowloading this and that while Aframe was just doing the code on jsbin and then pasting it onto your actual code for the webgape but this time I am making a whole game with this so it took me a very long time to even get started on Phaser. The game I am making is a quiz game.

## Tinkering
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRWKxB9Hm0) is what I used to finally get a hang of Phaser and be able to start off. I dowloaded a file and coded an index.html and another file where all the javascript code will go. At the end of the video it says that you must have a black canvas which confused me because the person only gave one small bit of the the code but after looking [here on the phaser website](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1#:~:text=var%20config%20%3D%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20type%3A%20Phaser.AUTO%2C%0A%20%20%20%20width%3A%20800%2C%0A%20%20%20%20height%3A%20600%2C%0A%20%20%20%20scene%3A%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20preload%3A%20preload%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20create%3A%20create%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20update%3A%20update%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%7D%3B%0A%0Avar%20game%20%3D%20new%20Phaser.Game(config)%3B) I added it to my `game.js` and the black canvas showed up. I tinkered more by adding sprites, and changing the size of the blank canvas. 

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Out of all the EDP steps I am on number two. Research the problem. This is because I am yet to learn so much about my tool it feels like I'm being thrown into the Mariana Trench. There is so much depth to Phaser and I am still exploring all the possiblities and ways I can make my quiz game using Phaser before the end of the year. 

## Skills
The skills I am developing in ways that apply outside this project are how to google and how to learn. As mentioned before, this project feels like I'm being thrown into the deep with Phaser. It was really hard for me to navigate through finally finding how to start up and start tinkering with Phaser but I managed to do it because it was necessary. I have learned how to motivate myself into learning more about my tool by involving my favourite characters. When I like something I tend to be more involved so that helps. I also am learning to google things more. Look at more videos and posts explaining how to start your tools or fix the the problems your are having. It is all really helpful rather than sticking to one video.

## Conculsion 
Overall, I look forward to mastering Phaser because it will make things more fun and easy for me. Each time I write a blog I realize I learn a lot from these Freedom Projects and how helpful it is for my future.
